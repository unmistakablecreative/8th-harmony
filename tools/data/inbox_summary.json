Amos\u2019s approach stands out because he\u2019s not just talking about using AI in business, he\u2019s living it\u2014running a company that is scaling with AI agents instead of a big team. This journey is challenging all the old rules about growth, and the results are already sparking interest among 35,000 growth-focused executives Amos engages with regularly.Amos offers a candid look at what happens when you throw away the traditional growth playbook and replace it with autonomy, efficiency, and a new sense of creativity. His story is both unconventional and highly practical, and I think it aligns with the conversations you foster on the show.Thanks again for considering,Anne Palomo From: Anne Palomo Sent: Monday, September 15, 2025 6:02:10 PM To: srini@unmistakablemedia.com <srini@unmistakablemedia.com> Subject: The Autonomous Age: Humans in their zone of genius Hi Srinivas,Listening to your conversation with Paul Millerd about breaking away from the \"wrong life\" and assembling a set of principles for genuine fulfillment got me thinking about how we craft our own paths\u2014sometimes in ways that completely flip the script on what business is supposed to look like.I wanted to introduce you to Amos Bar-Joseph. After scaling and exiting two B2B startups with the classic unicorn mentality, Amos realized that old playbook was losing meaning. He and two co-founders are now building Swan AI, aiming for $30M ARR using only themselves and a network of AI agents. No sprawling teams, just intelligence powering scale\u2014a true experiment in autonomy, purpose, and reinvention.Amos believes the future belongs to businesses focused on scaling real human relationships, not headcount. His latest work with Swan AI is about designing agents that spot intent, qualify, and reach out to leads in a way that feels personal, yet entirely powered by AI. With a community of 35,000 executives invested in growth and GTM, Amos is igniting conversations around replacing conveyor-belt thinking with something a lot more meaningful.I think your audience would appreciate hearing how Amos navigated his own \"pathless path\" and what it really means to design a career\u2014and company\u2014on your own terms.Best,Anne Palomo",

    "message_id": "19953cda88d82d87",
    "body": "Hi Srinivas,Would you like to speak with neurologist and novelist Sean Pauzauskie about the long-standing relationship between medicine and literature? He authored the forthcoming novel STAGE OF FOOLS (High Frequency Press; Oct 20), which sprung from the connection between the two disciplines: by day he studies the human brain with clinical probes; by night, he imagines the inner lives of characters. At first glance, they couldn\u2019t seem more different, but both ask the same fundamental question: what does it mean to be alive and aware of the world?Pauzauskie argues that this overlap is not so surprising: doctors have long turned to literature\u2014Chekhov, William Carlos Williams, Abraham Verghese, to name a few\u2014because medicine itself begins in narrative. Patients arrive with fragments of a story, and physicians must interpret and weave them into a meaningful whole. Where medicine resolves uncertainty with lab results, fiction lingers in it.In STAGE OF FOOLS, the protagonist suffers from cognitive-motor dissociation, a condition in which patients may be fully conscious but appear comatose. Pauzauskie, who\u2019s treated many people suffering from CMD, renders what it might feel like to live in that borderland between silence and speech, thought and action\u2014territory he can only partially reach medically.Sean also works at the forefront of the emerging field of neurorights, helping craft landmark legislation to protect neural data\u2014the electrical traces of thought and personhood. In an interview Sean can talk about:Why so many physicians turn to writing, and how diagnosis and narrative overlapHow literature and medicine approach human fragility from different anglesThe novel STAGE OF FOOLS and its roots in real neurological conditionsThe promise and perils of neurotechnology, and what it means for the future of consciousnessCan I send you a copy? Thanks for considering! Warmly,Emma McGlashenPublicist, PressShopPR.comE: emma@pressshoppr.comC: 734 834 0737ABOUT SEAN PAUZAUSKIEDr. Sean Pauzauskie is a practicing hospital neurologist in the University of Colorado system, where he conducts clinical research employing neurotechnology, primarily for the optimization of epilepsy management. He is the medical director of the NeuroRights Foundation, an active member of the American Academy of Neurology and The American Medical Association, and his research experience includes time at The National Institute of Mental Health, The Energy and Commerce Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Kaufmann Foundation for entrepreneurship.Born in Alaska and raised in Topeka, Kansas, Dr. Pauzauskie was mentored by and wrote his literature thesis with Stephen Jan Parker, a favorite pupil of Vladimir Nabokov. He lives with his wife and Siberian husky in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. His literacy scholarship has been presented at the International Nabokov Society Conference in Montreux, Switzerland, and elsewhere. Stage of Fools is his debut novel. More at seanpauzauskie.com.Q&A WITH SEAN PAUZAUSKIESTAGE OF FOOLS is narrated by Steven Levinson, a man hospitalized and in a coma after nearly drowning. He hears what happens around him but cannot move or speak. This state of consciousness is not well-understood, but there is mounting research that suggests there is more brain activity in these patients than previously believed. As a neurologist, why did you choose to explore this condition in your novel?As they say, \u201cwrite what you know.\u201d At the start of my career I found determining a prognosis for comas among the most difficult cases medically and scientifically, precisely because of how little the condition reveals. When I learned about cognitive-motor dissociation (CMD), which is a newly discovered state of consciousness wherein coma patients are mentally active while still physically immobile, it excited and concerned me. It was exciting because it offered physicians new avenues to do the most good for people in each unique situation\u2014and concerning because it made me question if we give up hope too soon in certain instances, as we know CMD confers improved outcomes even if it presents identically to less optimistic situations. I believed a novel exploring CMD would help me and others process this knowledge, as well as honor and raise awareness about these patients who can\u2019t speak for themselves.Why set this novel within the framework of Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear?I wanted to tell a contemporary story in a classic way, and Shakespeare has always lent itself well to this pursuit. In our world of billionaires and oligarchs, seeing if a King Lear can learn from his mistakes also poses the question of if anything truly changes or if the same old story holds in modern times. Furthermore, a character in a coma allows for frequent soliloquy, which draws in an audience by sharing private thoughts, in the stage-like setting of a hospital room. The play King Lear as a whole also fits my narrative best, with his lifetime of lived experiences to consider and his intense rumination on his compromised judgment that literally drives him mad. I additionally wanted to explore the Jungian notion that \u201cthose who look outward, dream; while those who look inward, awaken,\u201d which I felt this framework could simultaneously accomplish.The book is filled with family intrigue and profound personal development. Have you seen people in the room with non-responsive patients act in the same ways the characters in the book do? And for people who do recover, are they typically lucid, confused, radically changed?I do see patients and families react similarly to the characters in the book though not to the same extremes as Levinson\u2019s children. It is well known that in times of crisis, families revert to their core elements and all the tensions that can spell. So oftentimes having the privilege to care for these patients also demands an equal and sometimes greater effort to aid the families as they navigate that crisis. We hope this prevents such heightened drama, though some drama is natural and impossible to completely avoid. As for those who recover, they are seldom the same people afterwards. Memory, mood, sleep, and even personality can be altered. Sometimes we also see dramatic shifts in a person\u2019s interests,values, and sense of identity.The book features an emerging real-world treatment called ultrasonic thalamic stimulation\u2014what does that procedure do and why did you incorporate it into your story?There are broadly two types of neurotechnologies: those that read brain activity, and those that directly influence it. Ultrasonic thalamic stimulation directly influences brain activity by using soundwaves to stimulate the thalamus, an olive-sized structure deep in the brain that plays an important role in maintaining consciousness, to attempt to \u201cjumpstart\u201d it the same way you might jumpstart a car\u2019s engine. I chose to feature it in the book because it suits the story and because I wanted to raise awareness about such experimental treatments. Every life-saving therapy that we take for granted now was once in the experimental stage, and we expect that neurology will see more of these treatments come to fruition than any other field over the next five to ten years. And so I wanted to portray what this might look like, as I\u2019m hopeful for the tools available to neurology practice and most importantly, for patients.Why did you choose to use \u201cthe stillness of a coma\u201d as a narrative device for Steven\u2019s character? How did it help him reflect or change in ways he otherwise wouldn\u2019t have?The stillness of a coma helps to portray Steven\u2019s development. He\u2019s able to narrate with more candor, more frequently. With no one there to argue the facts with him, he\u2019s able to remember everything deep within his mind. This honest, isolated depth of reflection allows him to change in ways he wouldn\u2019t if, for example, he had to argue with his family over what was real and imagined from his life, whose version of the story was accurate.This narrative device also allows Steven\u2019s imagination to flourish and permit the reader to make judgments about what it says about him. If memory is imagination or a form of fiction itself, as some suggest, this vantage point helps this idea resonate on the page.You\u2019re the Medical Director of Neurorights Foundation, an organization that advocates for brainwave privacy in the face of rapid innovations in neurotechnology. Though a work of fiction, the stakes of this novel are very real. How does the emerging issue of neurotech rights provide context for your story?Writing this novel was nearly simultaneous to my involvement with the Foundation, so it\u2019s somewhat surreal to see the two growing together and converging. I see them as different expressions of the same underlying issue: through neurotechnologies, the brain and mind are poised for revolutionary change that will redefine what it means to be human. As technology itself is fundamentally ethically neutral, it is up to us to ensure that more good than harm comes from them, as we have thus far seen with the nuclear, genetic, and information revolutions of the 20th century. Narrative will be a key factor driving the public adoption of neurotechnology, as the Foundation has discussed at length. This novel, I hope, contributes to this narrative by exploring one patient\u2019s issues in an intensive care unit vis-a-vis the promises of neurotechnology, as a representation of the 21st-century world soon to change.PRAISE FOR STAGE OF FOOLS\"Sean Pauzauskie is from that great tradition of doctors who also excel in literature. As with Walker Percy, another example, we get in Pauzauskie\u2019s Stage of Fools the tragicomedies of the flesh as well as the acutely sketched-out questions about the mind and the soul. Sean Pauzauskie is a very promising novelist, with a big heart and unique angle, as shown in this uniquely rewarding new work.\" \u2014Rick Moody, author of The Ice Storm\u201cStage of Fools offers an innovative, compelling appropriation and repurposing of Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear. But the principal character lies comatose in a San Francisco hospital, able to hear, think, and feel. Recollection and disintegration drive a bold family narrative toward a riveting conclusion and epiphany. Pauzauskie, by creating multi-faceted characters, skillfully refashions the story of an old king into a modern-day enriched parable of hope, suffering, and loss.\u201d \u2014David Bergeron, author of The Duke of Lennox",

There\u2019s a certain paradox he embodies that I haven\u2019t seen elsewhere. Here\u2019s what I mean: Josh has commanded more than 150 soldiers as a military officer, then pivoted to leading global employee experience at Tier 11\u2014not by following the script, but by completely reimagining the relationship between people and organizations. His view? Instead of employees being passive recipients of culture, they\u2019re active subscribers making a daily choice, which is a real shift from traditional HR.What if the way we structure talent really is due for a creative overhaul, one led by people who\u2019ve seen high-stakes leadership and then applied it to remote teams across the world? Josh\u2019s co-founder role at SuperHired also means he\u2019s living this intersection of AI, recruitment, and the very human art of talent discovery. I\u2019m constantly surprised by one thing he found: when you approach recruitment as if each candidate\u2019s experience is a product in itself, even rejected applicants become your best advocates. That\u2019s not common in business, especially at scale.Would love to explore this dynamic with your audience. If you\u2019re interested in hearing a bit more or want to talk through possibilities, just let me know.Tom MeredithP.S. Josh sometimes jokes that his strict military discipline is now channelled into onboarding spreadsheets\u2014maybe that\u2019s the hidden secret to retention.

After scaling and exiting two B2B startups with the classic unicorn mentality, Amos realized that old playbook was losing meaning. He and two co-founders are now building Swan AI, aiming for $30M ARR using only themselves and a network of AI agents. No sprawling teams, just intelligence powering scale\u2014a true experiment in autonomy, purpose, and reinvention.Amos believes the future belongs to businesses focused on scaling real human relationships, not headcount. His latest work with Swan AI is about designing agents that spot intent, qualify, and reach out to leads in a way that feels personal, yet entirely powered by AI. With a community of 35,000 executives invested in growth and GTM, Amos is igniting conversations around replacing conveyor-belt thinking with something a lot more meaningful.I think your audience would appreciate hearing how Amos navigated his own \"pathless path\" and what it really means to design a career\u2014and company\u2014on your own terms.Best,Anne Palomo",

    "body": "Dear Srinivas, Hope this message finds you well&#8212;I&#8217;m writing today regarding New York Times bestselling author Jon Levy&#8217;s new book, TEAM INTELLIGENCE: How Brilliant Leaders Unlock Collective Genius (Harper Business, 10/7). Roy Wood Jr., host of CNN Have I Got News for you and former Daily Show correspondent says, &#8220;Team Intelligence is like a TED Talk that got tired of being polite and started telling the truth.&#8221; Ever wonder why some of our most effective leaders aren&#8217;t known for the skills we&#8217;ve been told are essential for great leadership? Would you describe Elon Musk or Steve Jobs as having empathy or humility? Of course not, and yet they&#8217;ve led teams that achieved extraordinary results. So, what leadership attributes, habits, and skills do cause teams to become more than the sum of their parts? Why does a team made up of superstars often underperform? What causes teams to work together effectively and produce high team intelligence? For the past fifteen years behavioral scientist and New York Times bestselling author Jon Levy has gathered thousands of the most respected leaders from across industry&#8212;Nobel Laureates, Olympic team captains, astronauts who commanded the ISS, military leaders, and corporate CEOs&#8212;to find answers to these questions. In TEAM INTELLIGENCE, he unpacks the myths that hold leaders and their teams back and points out the paradox of success: focusing on creating teams that operate well is what makes an effective leader, but focusing purely on the leader does almost nothing for the team. In TEAM INTELLIGENCE discover cutting-edge research, surprising stories, and the essential habits that unlock collective genius. Let me know if I can send over an early copy (digital or physical) and look forward to connecting with you soon.

    "body": "Hey Srinivas, Hope you had a lovely weekend! As you know, career instability and the looming uncertainty facing soon-to-be graduates always seem to dominate headlines; an unfortunate truth underscored by U.S. employee engagement rates hitting a 10-year low in 2024. I\u2019d like to suggest a conversation with William Vanderbloemen, Forbes Contributor & CEO of touted search group, VSG, who\u2019s providing a playbook to reframe how your audience should view the career search. His approach centers on proven assessments that highlight strength traits, distilled from more than 30,000 interviews across the workforce. William\u2019s new book, Work How You Are Wired: 12 Data-Driven Steps to Finding a Job You Love (HaperCollins, 10/7), addresses why some stand out, and others falter, with his original composite called the Vander Index. 12 habits of top performers \u2013 each drawn from research of 2,500+ executive searches and 30,000+ interviews exemplifying internal habits that help: Compare traits with prompts & post-chapter assessments that surface core strengths and non-negotiables. Measure natural wiring and career aspirations with Ennegram and DiSC data to make concrete connections that have long-term fulfillment in their career paths Navigate style types (like \u2018Connector\u2019 and \u2018Anticipator\u2019), and which roles you should actively avoid, and why. Including more detail below. Are you working on anything at the moment that William can add to, or can I share a manuscript in the meantime? Gratefully, Marcus \u2013 Work How You Are Wired: 12 Data-Driven Steps to Finding a Job You Love (HaperCollins, 10/7) It\u2019s no secret that some people are just better suited to their jobs than others. It\u2019s time to find out why and how you can achieve this same success and happiness too. Remember taking that career test in grade school where you were told you\u2019d make a great federal judge or an exemplary lighthouse keeper? In this book, executive search CEO William Vanderbloemen takes that concept and maps it against hundreds of thousands of data points, forming a roadmap for all of us on how to choose careers that align with our personalities so that we are happy at work. William has become an unlikely business expert over his long and continuing career. Combining over fifteen years of ministry experience as a Senior Pastor with the best practices of executive search, William created a brand-new industry: executive search for faith-based organizations. Prior to founding his own search company, William studied under a mentor with over twenty-five years of executive search experience at the highest level. William has surveyed thousands of people in the workforce. He\u2019s asked what their job is and how they feel about them. He also asked them to report their scores on leading personality assessments. Now, in this groundbreaking guide, William helps you recognize the traits you possess that make you happy and then match those against your possible careers to find the best match.

    "body": "Dear Srinivas,I'm following up to see if you'd like a copy of psychologist Dr. Jonathan Mathias Lassiter\u2019s forthcoming essay collection, HOW I KNOW WHITE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY AND OTHER STORIES (Legacy Lit; November 4, 2025), which is a pointed critique of racism in the mental health field\u2014as well as a vivid recollection of growing up Black and gay in a world that privileges the white, straight, and wealthy. From experiencing racism as a child in Augusta, Georgia, to alienation in San Francisco\u2014within both queer and straight communities\u2014Lassiter weaves personal narrative with professional insight, exposing systemic barriers facing Black and POC psychologists and patients. Throughout, he challenges the dominance of the \u201cwhiteness mindset\u201d (a worldview rooted in competition and individualism that continues to shape American psychology) and asks us to reimagine the field of mental health so that it wholly meets the needs of POC, LGBTQ+, and disabled communities. With HOW I KNOW WHITE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY, Dr. Lassiter asks, what would mental healthcare look like if it centered lived experience and healing over hierarchy?Can I send you a copy? Dr. Lassiter is a great conversationalist and is available for interviews.Best,Emma McGlashenshe/theyPublicistC: 734 834 0737www.PressShopPR.comABOUT THE AUTHORJonathan Mathias Lassiter, PhD is a polymath whose mission is to help others heal and thrive. He is a licensed clinical psychologist, author, speaker, and educator. Dr. Lassiter has been featured in NBC, PBS, Sirius XM, Forbes, and more. His psychotherapy practice is based in New York City.Q&A WITH JONATHAN LASSITERThis book gives voice to your frustration with how psychology, as it\u2019s commonly taught and practiced, neglects patients who aren\u2019t white, straight, and/or able-bodied. The essays, however, touch on subjects as wide-ranging as the racism you endured as a child in Georgia to your disillusionment with San Francisco\u2019s gay community. How do these varied experiences illuminate the broader problems in psychology and the state of social justice in this country?The stories put a human face on a problem, \u201cthe whiteness mindset,\u201d that is wreaking harm on our society and the field of mental health, past, present, and potentially future. The whiteness mindset is believing and behaving as if \u201cthere is not enough to go around,\u201d one must \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d and \u201ckill or be killed.\u201d This mindset protects certain people, their dominance, their position\u2013but it also hurts them, and not just people who look like me. This book looks at how all of us are affected by this mindset. The stories provide an emotional anchor for a psychological and philosophical ill. The stories also illustrate how the mindset, when it runs rampant, impacts not just society\u2019s mental health but also the politics around us. Let\u2019s look at the civil unrest happening now: they can only arise when a society embodies and perpetuates the whiteness mindset. The whiteness mindset has convinced past immigrants, poor people of all races, and other would-be allies that a scapegoat \u2013 \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d \u2013 are their enemies and are taking away resources from them. They don\u2019t see one another as being part of a growing community but as competition and a threat who must be eliminated.The field of psychology, with its foundation in Western Europe, is steeped in this culture. How can we change that? The whiteness mindset predominates now but such has not always been the case. We change that by embracing a more ancient mindset\u2013one rooted in the original societies of African, Asia, and South America\u2013that embraces unity, balance, harmony, and justice. We change the field of psychology by putting these mindsets front and center and not making them electives or special topics but the core of how we understand and practice healing and how we engage in our relationships.Throughout the book your voice and humor shine through. In one essay you share a darkly funny story about an internship where each participant had to spend two hours in a setting where they would be a minority. They sent you, a gay Black man, to a sports bar because you don\u2019t like sports\u2014and then they failed you. How does this story encapsulate how mainstream psychology struggles to meet psychologists and patients with different lived experiences? That story exposes psychology\u2019s cultural limitations and myopathy, since western psychology only focuses on European and white ways of understanding and being. Even when discussing mental health problems, psychology only understands them from white perspectives. This narrowness reduces psychology from being a study of the human mind to a study of the white human mind. It cuts off potential non-western ways of healing that could be beneficial to everyone, including white people. Furthermore, the whiteness mindset in psychology ensures that people of the global majority are at best seen as problems to be solved, deviations from a white norm, and never as mental health professionals with legitimate ways of healing outside of European and white standards.In the book you write, \u201cto understand, appreciate, and promote multiculturalism requires a lifelong process. I would de-emphasize diversity and center cultural humility.\u201d What does cultural humility look like and how do you think diversity initiatives fall short?Cultural humility looks like understanding that culture deeply influences everything we do and how we make sense of the world. It also requires that we understand that culture is not something to be mastered or manipulated. We must be continually cultivating a non-judgmental curiosity of how we and others believe, behave, and make sense of the world. Cultural humility is a lifelong process, not an endpoint. Current diversity initiatives often feel like a box to check off.In all sorts of settings, most Black people have experienced being the only Black person in the room. You write, \u201cwhen you are Black, cultural paranoia\u2014also known as a distrust of white people in predominantly non-Black spaces as a defense against racism\u2014is a healthy thing.\u201d How do you guide clients through alienating situations like this?I first validate their concerns and normalize that they are not alone in feeling this way. I emphasize that these culturally isolating\u2013and often hostile\u2013spaces are the problem, not them. When working with clients experiencing cultural paranoia, one priority is to help them understand their suspicion as a strength they can harness while ensuring it does not override their ability to think and function. I help them to meet their emotions where they are, anticipate potential consequences, and then set boundaries so they don\u2019t have to take these things home. We also work together to build in moments of rejuvenation and joy.When seeing Black patients, where do non-Black psychologists most often fail? What do they miss about Black history, culture, and experiences that keeps them from providing the best possible care?In general, non-Black psychologists do not know Black people or Black culture. They may know of them, but they don\u2019t know them. Lacking a nuanced understanding of the history, culture, and experience is a barrier. Furthermore, without cultural humility and non-judgmental curiosity, Black patients become a set of symptoms to be solved instead of whole human beings to understand and with whom to take a healing journey.PRAISE FOR HOW I KNOW WHITE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY\"This is the best book I\u2019ve read in a long time. It\u2019s so good I wish I had written it. It corroborates the crazy-making experiences of Black Americans that are too often denied or dismissed as over sensitivity by the white power structure and offers strategies for surviving and thriving in an inhospitable world. Every conscientious American should read Dr. Lassiter\u2019s brilliant book.\" \u2015Dr. Carl Hart, author of Drug Use for Grown-Ups\"Phewwwww, this book!!! Damn every white person needs to read it.\" \u2015Dr. Courtney Tracy, author of Your Unconscious is Showing\"Pulling from his lived experience and his work as a psychologist, Lassiter breaks down how 'whiteness' operates as a mindset built on division and control. This bold and necessary book challenges us to name it, undo it, and begin the real work of healing. It\u2019s a call toward collective liberation.\" \u2015Clay Cane, New York Times bestselling author of The Grift\"Dr. Lassiter's fierce, funny, and furious diagnosis has changed how I think about the ways whiteness shapes the world\u2014and myself. This book about the head is bursting with heart and we learn as we watch him attempting to navigate a world whose framework is founded on the often absurd propositions of whiteness.\" \u2015Baynard Woods, author of Inheritance\"During a time of racial disinformation and bigotry, Dr. Lassiter's book unpacks this crisis on a psychological and scholarly level. Both insightful and personal, his provocative writing pushes past the dated trope of being another 'Dear White People' reaction\u2014but an empowering literary embodiment of Black resilience that's timely and necessary.\" \u2015Ernest Owens, author of The Case for Cancel Culture\"Dr. Lassiter is prolific in his teachings and writings, as he honors those who are often overlooked by the majority!!! I am super excited for the world to have a first-row seat in learning how he manages his frustrations in a quest to de-center whiteness, so ALL can live optimally as their full authentic selves.\" \u2015Dr. Ayana Jordan, Barbara Wilson Associate Professor of Psychiatry at NYU Grossman School of Medicine\"This book is what we\u2019ve been waiting for. It's a must-read. Dr. Lassiter takes us on a necessary emotional roller coaster as he navigates becoming a prolific Black psychologist in a sea of whiteness. Providing readers a diagnostic of 'whiteness' finally gives us the language to describe that which we\u2019ve known for so long as simply 'crazy' behavior. How I Know White People are Crazy and Other Stories is a balm, a testament, a cauldron of healing, stories for that which has plagued us for so long in this society.\" \u2015Sharrell D. Luckett, PhD, editor of Black Acting Methods",

The world\u2019s best brands didn\u2019t just stumble on success; they mastered the art of hacking human psychology. In HACKING THE HUMAN MIND: The Behavioral Science Secrets Behind 17 of the World\u2019s Best Brands, MichaelAaron Flicker and Richard Shotton reveal the behavioral science behind these tricks. In a conversation with coauthor, founder and host of the Consumer Behavior Lab MichaelAaron Flicker, you'll unpack Behavioral lessons like: Liquid Death\u2019s \u201cMurder Your Thirst\u201d: Breaking category norms (death metal branding for water?) exploits the Von Restorff effect, making it impossible to ignore. Snickers\u2019 \u201cYou\u2019re Not You When You\u2019re Hungry\u201d: Humor and a clear trigger (hunger) bridge the gap between intention and action\u2014proven to boost sales by 15.9%. Amazon Prime\u2019s \u201cSunk Cost Fallacy\u201d: Paying upfront for shipping makes customers spend more to \u201cget their money\u2019s worth\u201d\u2014even when logic says otherwise. Aperol\u2019s Social Proof Hack: Its unmistakable color and glassware turn drinkers into walking billboards, subtly convincing others to order the same. Guinness\u2019s \u201cPratfall Effect\u201d: Admitting its slow pour time (a flaw!) actually boosted appeal by signaling authenticity and quality. Behavioral science shapes all our choices\u2014Through pop-culture infused conversation, you'll learn tactics that can be applied by marketers, entrepreneurs, or anyone curious about why we buy what we buy, so you too can make your brand the one people reach for\u2015without them ever really knowing why. Would you like to see a copy of HACKING THE HUMAN MIND or schedule some time to speak with MichaelAaron? Here are a couple of relevant examples of MichaelAaron speaking and being interviewed. Would you be interested in having him on the podcast or receiving a book?

    "body": "Hi Srinivas, Taylor Swift just proved you can have record-breaking career success AND a thriving relationship\u2014but not by trying to excel at everything simultaneously. Her approach offers a blueprint that everyday working women can actually follow. Taylor Swift is the perfect example of how any ambitious woman can use the practical strategies from Amanda Goetz's new book, Toxic Grit: How to Have It All and (Actually) Love What You Have (Sourcebooks, October 21, 2025) to achieve HER goals. What working women can steal from Taylor's playbook: Rotate your main character like Swift - Focus intensely on career goals for defined periods (like Swift's 2-year Eras Tour commitment) while keeping relationships on maintenance mode, then flip the script. Bake bread for Zoe Kravitz, binge The Summer I Turned Pretty, etc.Plan recovery like you plan launches - Swift's strategic breaks between projects aren't downtime, they're essential \"spin cycles\" that prevent burnout and fuel creativity, something corporate women desperately need.Master role transitions - Swift seamlessly shifts from business negotiator to vulnerable artist to supportive partner by treating each as a distinct \"characters\" with different energy requirements.Communicate your season to your inner circle - Swift's team and Travis know when she's in full work mode versus relationship mode, eliminating the guilt of not being \"everything to everyone.\" Swift doesn't try to be at 100% in all areas simultaneously. Working women can apply this by identifying which \"character\" (professional, partner, friend, parent) gets front-burner focus each quarter while keeping others on intentional maintenance. You can see some of her insights featured here on CNBC Make It. Would you be interested in speaking with her about why Taylor Swift's been so successful in both work and life, how other ambitious women can follow in suit and other insights from Amanda\u2019s book Toxic Grit? Amanda can break down these strategies into actionable steps for your audience. Best, Camille Camille Chapman | Fortier Public Relations | camille@fortierpr.com | 603.306.2345 About the Author Amanda Goetz is a 2x founder, 4x chief marketing officer, and was a single mom to three small children before finding love again. In her new book, Toxic Grit: How to Have It All and (Actually) Love What You Have (Sourcebooks, October 21, 2025), Goetz shares what it took to climb the corporate ladder, build and sell House of Wise (a CBD supplement company targeting women) all while being a single mom and enjoying the life she was building. She spent two decades building and growing consumer-facing brands before shifting to writing, teaching, and coaching ambitious working parents on how to balance success and life, amassing 150,000+ followers learning to balance success and sanity from her. She graduated summa cum laude from the University of Illinois and, after hustling the streets of New York City for over a decade, is now testing out every sunscreen in the world on her children in Miami.

A few months ago I was trying to optimize Raycast. It has AI built in, but to get it working the way I wanted, I had to open ChatGPT and ask it how to talk to Raycast\u2019s AI\u2014just so it could run a simple audit. That\u2019s when it hit me: I\u2019m using one AI to figure out how to use another AI so that other AI can maybe do something it should already know how to do. This isn\u2019t a Raycast problem. It\u2019s everywhere. You ask GPT for an image prompt, paste it into a generator, and the result sucks\u2014so you\u2019re back rewriting the prompt, repasting, and trying again. Then you ask it for an email, and now you\u2019re fixing the tone, cleaning up the formatting, copying it into another app, and rewriting half of it because the output is garbage. This is the loop: one tool gives you a broken piece of something, another gives you a different broken piece, and none of them finish the job. And every step in between? That\u2019s on you. You\u2019re formatting, reformatting, renaming files, rewriting prompts, re-explaining what you\u2019re trying to do, regenerating, and cleaning up messes from systems that pretend they\u2019re doing the work. Whatever time you think AI is saving you, you lose dealing with all the stupid things it makes you do. It doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re building, remember what you said, and has no clue what comes next\u2014it just dumps half-finished output in your lap and leaves you to clean it up. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll look at why nobody in their right mind would ever replace a real employee with this bullshit.",
